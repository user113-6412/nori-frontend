          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            We are a small British family team of Environmental Scientists and Civil Engineers who have discovered Nori on our journey to eating more plant-based foods. We started eating a lot of Nori to improve hormonal function and iodine consumption.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Nori is a gentle way to increase iodine consumption, unlike some other seaweeds, like kombu, which are potentially too concentrated in iodine. Nori is also a very healthy and low carb alternative for grain-based wraps and snacks, which we also liked.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Our Search for &quot;Clean&quot; Nori, Guided By Tea</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            We were worried that we were consuming a lot of Nori, but we had no idea where it came from. We were worried that companies aren&apos;t disclosing where it was grown, if it was grown in polluted areas, whether it was lab tested, nor how fresh it was.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            We had previously worked on a passionate project where we travelled to remote mountainous villages in China and South East Asia to source the best quality loose leaf teas, so we decided to use this experience and to go to the source again, but this time, to find the best and &apos;cleanest&apos; Nori for ourselves.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">&quot;Clean&quot; Nori and South Korea</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            We specifically wanted to source our Nori from South Korea only, because South Korea produces the best quality Nori after Japan, but it avoids the radioactive areas of the Japanese sea and has much cleaner, less polluted sea areas and much more stringent environmental regulations compared to China, albeit being more expensive than Chinese Nori.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">&quot;Clean&quot; Nori and Dadohaehaesang</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            After a long search, we succeeded in our venture of finding this clean sea area in the waters off Wando and Jindo islands, near the western branch of Dadohaehaesang National Park. There, there is a large area of pristine open sea, with no industry and no cities nearby, which is quite a rarity in the populated countries of South East Asia where Nori is produced.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            We have partnered with a family, who have been producing Nori for 30 years in a special way, drying it 20 times on a lower temperature instead of drying it 4 times at a higher temperature as is traditionally done, to produce a high quality end product.

          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            After having successfully found our Nori, we realised that we would love to share our finding with others, to not only allow access to clean Nori to others, but also for the selfish pursuit of giving ourselves a perpetual access to a fresh supply of clean Nori. This is how PureTide Nori was born.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">How PureTide is Sourced</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            All our Nori is sourced for ourselves and our family, so we rigorously test every batch for quality and contaminants.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            To top it all off, we are proud to support you and ourselves in the consumption of this environmentally friendly crop and increasing the biodiversity in agriculture by encouraging the consumption of seaweed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            We deeply believe that the positive change to the environment begins with our personal food choices, and Nori can be a very Planet-friendly crop, so we really want to inspire others to love it as much as we do.
